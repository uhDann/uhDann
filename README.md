## 👋 i am an Artificial Intelligence expert in making, a technical project manager, and a changemaker. i love design and the thrill of the unknown. 


i build meaningful **communities** and **systems** that think, feel, and sometimes float. 

👨‍🏫 trained in robotics and artificial intelligence @ ucl, as one of 30 full tuition scholars, i move between: 
> **code, clay,** and **complexity.**

from leading agentic ai development at cisco to prototyping acoustic levitation systems, i’m drawn to the edges - of what’s possible, of what’s useful, of what’s meaningful.

🏗️ i’ve founded communities, hosted conferences, mentored students, and shaped pandemic policy. but whether i’m in a lab, on a stage, coding or sketching with fusion360, the goal stays the same: 
> **build with intention,** 
> **lead with empathy**, and 
> **leave things better than i found them.**

☎️ let’s connect! i am open to industry opportunities, awesome collaboration and public speaking.
